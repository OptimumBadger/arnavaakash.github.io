I am Arnav Aakash, a graduate student in Operations Research at [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), specializing in optimization and mathematical modeling. My interests lie in developing theoretical frameworks for stochastic and linear programming to address large-scale optimization challenges, as well as  exploring their applications in financial models. Before my masterâ€™s, I earned a degree in Chemical Engineering with a Computer Science minor from [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) and worked for two years as a Research Scientist at [Dr. Reddy's Laboratories](https://www.drreddys.com/). In my free time, I enjoy solving puzzles, listening to podcasts, and watching movies.

In the past, I worked on military aircraft scheduling and load palletization problems in collaboration with the Defence Research and Development Organization [(DRDO)](http://www.drdo.gov.in/) and the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics [(CAIR)](https://drdo.gov.in/drdo/labs-and-establishments/centre-artificial-intelligence-robotics-cair), India on [CARS-52](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360835224004625?via%3Dihub#gp005) project. These projects involved developing optimization models and heuristics to improve operational efficiency in defense logistics. Currently, I am focusing on formulating two-stage stochastic optimization problems, where the objective function and constraints are influenced by uncertain parameters. My research aims to design robust frameworks that address real-world complexities in large-scale systems.
